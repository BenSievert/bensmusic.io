			My name is Ben Sievert and I teach guitar lessons at <a
				href="https://www.hipcatmusicschool.com/home"
				class="text-rose-800 underline">Hip Cat Music School</a
			> in Bloomington-Normal. I've been playing the guitar for 17 years in a wide variety of genres
			and styles. I've studied the guitar and other instruments one on one with several different instructors
			and believe that a complete music education is about more than any one genre or style.
